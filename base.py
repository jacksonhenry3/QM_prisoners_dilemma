# Note:
# - For two qubits, the joint state basis we are using is np.array([|CC>, |CD>, |DC>, |DD>])
# - expm computes the matrix exponential of a given square matrix. (ask if you dont know what that means)
# - np.kron(A, B) is the Kronecker product, representing the tensor product of two operators or states.

# Please feel free to ask questions
# I'd also request that you keep approximate track of how much time this takes.
